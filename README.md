### Basic_HTML_CSS, Basic_HTML_and_JavaScript_1
These two projects are the first exercises with HTLM in combination with CSS and JavaScript.

### Creating-a-CSS-menu
In this exercise, I created a rollover menu using HTML and CSS.

### Effecting-images-with-CSS
In this exercise, we created a photo container with a text overlay that appears when you hover the cursor over it. 

### HTML documents
In doing this exercise I did the following things:
<li>connect multiple simple webpages.</li>
<li>use pictures.</li>
<li>integrate a video in a webpage.</li>
